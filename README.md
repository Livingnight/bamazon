# bamazon

### The purpose of this site is to mimic an amazon like site that shows orders and gives the ability to make
###"purchases". I did the customer part and the manager part.

#Customer
####The customer part goes automatically shows the products and
####then allows the customer to choose which product and how much of that product they would like to purchase. If there
####is not enough stock it will inform the customer and allow them to choose a different amount.

#Manager
###The Manager has four different options to choose from.
1.View all products
2.View Low Inventory(less than 5)
3.Add Inventory to a specific product
4.Add a new item entirely to the database
